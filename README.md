The smooth blend of clean, reliable, and scalable platformer magic.

## Description ##

Créme Engine is the open-source 3D platformer engine we handcrafted to power SNM, AH2, EH:ME and all our future platformer projects going forward.

CE is the culmination of all the experience we've gained through the years, and was designed to be the final, dependable, and scalable solution for all our—and your—platformer needs.
